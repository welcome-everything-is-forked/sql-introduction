# sql-introduction
## Standard Exercise:
Using the [MySQL Database from the w3school website](https://www.w3schools.com/sql/trymysql.asp), answer the following questions (to keep a copy of your queries, after you find the solution, paste the query below each question):
1. What is the Average Product Price?
2. How many unique products are there?
3. Using the Customers table, isolate the first names of the customers in a new variable called CustomerFirstName; are there any customers with the same first name? If yes, how many duplicates are there?
4. Using the Orders table
   a. create a new variable that calculates the number of days between today and the OrderDate and call it DaysFromOrder.
   b. Now convert this variable from days to years and call it YearsFromOrder.
   c. What is the average difference between OrderDate and current date (in terms of years)?
   d. How many years have passed from the oldest order to the most recent one?
5. Using the Shippers table, create a new variable called Prefix where you isolate the prefix of the Phone variable.

## Advanced Exercise (optional):
Go to the w3school SQL web editor tool, look at each of the tables in there and see if you can build the star/snowflake schema that links all those tables to each other (something like the sample schema in the picture below). You can use pen and paper, a google spreadsheet or a more advanced tool such as lucidchart.
